# LLMthesis
Project made for my degree thesis.
A Generative LLMs system based on the same used on ChatGPT turbo 3.5.
It's a Question-Answering system available as a web application, where the user can ask questions about a document and get the right response.
The aim of the project was to overcome ChatGPT bias and allucination very common in these type of systems.
This is an interdisciplinary project for analize literary documents, in my case i used it for analize Michela Murgia's books.
